## Overview:

The Outdoor Activity Discovery app is designed to help users discover outdoor recreational spots in Chicago. Many city dwellers and tourists are unaware of the numerous nature-based opportunities available to them, facing challenges such as:

- Lack of centralized information about parks, campsites, and activity-friendly areas.
- Difficulty searching for specific activities like fishing or kayaking.
- Fragmented details on facilities and features.

The app addresses these issues by providing a centralized platform with curated recommendations, detailed descriptions, and search features to easily explore outdoor activities.
